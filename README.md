# Double Descent

I studied the double descent phenomenon in my "Theory of Deep Learning" class at CentraleSup√©lec.

We illustrated it on Linear Regression and explained it using [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18988.pdf).
We then experimented on neural networks and also observed an interpolation threshold, but which cannot be explained similarly because it is not a smoother model.

In this repository :
- TDL.ipynb : the notebook with the code and figures (random states imply random results but which should act similarly)
- TDL presentation : the poster we presented in class (and TDL annexes for appendix)
- TDL report : the report we submitted for this study
