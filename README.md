# Double Descent

I studied the double descent phenomenon in my "Theory of Deep Learning" class at CentraleSup√©lec.

We illustrated it on Linear Regression and explained it using [this paper]([https://link-url-here.or](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18988.pdf)https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18988.pdfg).
We then experimented on neural networks and also observed an interpolation threshold, but which cannot be explained similarly because it is not a smoother model.
